	<p>This is a NodeJs sever of my weather app running on port 8080, It serves current weather conditions of various cities across the globe by just initiating a search.</p>

	<p>It also serves a file upload function, i was able to upload files to a specified directory on my computer.</p>

	<p>Building with NodeJs is fun and i find it exciting.</p>
